(in progress)

I created a blog which included two different hex colors, two different pairing google fonts, background images, 2 buttons,  created a index.html, styles.css and an image folder through the command line. I made sure the files are named properly with the proper extensions. I also gathered images and content for the blog. I used symantic divs on my html file and properly link my external style sheet to my html file
